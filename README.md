GUI DESIGN PRINCIPLES: The layout is intended to be simple. The table in the lefthand side of the screen intuitively allows users to select an item, which then updates the hotel information on the side view. Two buttons are prominently displayed at the bottom allowing the user to add a new entry or delete the currently selected one. All information is avaiable at a glance. Buttons provide feedback with a color change.

OPERATION: To view hotel information, simply select a hotel in the table by clicking on it. The information on the side will update automatically. To add a new hotel, click "Add New" at the bottom and fill in all the fields, and presss "submit." You will return to the previous screen and the new entry will be visible on the table. To remove an entry, simply click the "remove entry" button and the entry will be removed from the table.
